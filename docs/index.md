# <center> __OUR STORY__ </center>

Green Cube Technologies began in 2015. After years in training and development industry, we realized that training only wont make people more productive and efficient. So we three came up with the plan with registering a Network and Software Company that will create something new in the market. We believed in our knowledge, ideas, products, services through which we achieved little success the  following year. In 2017, we developed ourselves as a Networking Consultant, Distributors of Various Products, Software Products and mainly a System Integrator Partner for our Clients.

Over the years, we are encouraged by our clients, friends and our well wishers to improve and keep on making impact on the IT market by delevering cutting edge solutions, ideas, innovations that will help us to reach a milestone that we set.

Our goal in building this company is to give people a voice. We want to create a name that listens to what our client need and gives them what they’re missing. Most importantly, we want Green Cube to be a brand that all our clients are proud to represent.
